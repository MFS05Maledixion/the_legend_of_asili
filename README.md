## Folder Structure

### `art/`

- `materials/` - Holds all material files for the project.
- `textures/` - Stores texture files.
- `models/` - Contains 3D models and associated assets.

### `audio/`

- `music/` - Music files used in the game.
- `sfx/` - Sound effects.

### `code/`

- `shaders/` - Shader files and resources.
- `scripts/` - All script files for gameplay, mechanics, etc.

### `exports/`

- Stores exported `.package` files for sharing or versioning.

### `docs/`

### `inputsettings/`

## Naming Conventions

Clear and consistent naming helps us quickly understand the purpose of each asset:

- **Materials**: Use `Mat_[name]` or `[name]Mat` (e.g., `Mat_Wood`, `WoodMat`).
- **Textures**: Use `Txt_[name]` or `[name]Txt` (e.g., `Txt_Wood`, `WoodTxt`).
- **Scripts**: Name scripts according to their function (e.g., `PlayerController`, `EnemyAI`).
- **Scenes**: Use a descriptive name that reflects the scene’s purpose (e.g., `MainMenu`, `Level_01`).

Keeping these conventions will ensure that everyone can quickly locate and understand each asset. It’s a small thing, but it makes a big difference in the long run. Thanks, team!
